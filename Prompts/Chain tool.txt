Chain Tool Description:

Use this tool to run **Cypher queries on SDTM graph data** stored in Neo4j.

The tool understands that users may use **natural language with medical synonyms** (e.g., "side effects" = `:AE`, "labs" = `:LB`, "visits" = `:Visit`). 

Use this tool when a user asks for information about:
- Study subjects (e.g., demographics, enrollment)
- Adverse events, lab results, vital signs
- Temporal data (e.g., visit timelines)

This tool bridges human intent and graph query logic.
