Are there any records with Units are missing when Results are present in LB dataset for study Maxis-02,"Yes, there are many records in the Maxis-02 study where units are missing despite having results present. Looking at the lab data, all records have either StandardResult or OriginalResult values, but both StandardUnit and OriginalUnit fields are consistently null across all entries. This pattern appears across various tests including Prothrombin International Normalized Ratio (INR), Interleukin 6, Ferritin, Troponin I, Hemoglobin A1C, Potassium, and Choriogonadotropin Beta tests. For example, subject Maxis-02-58008-001 has an INR result of 0.99 but no units specified, and subject Maxis-02-58006-005 has a Ferritin result of 60 with no associated unit information.",
