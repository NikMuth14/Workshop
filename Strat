MaxisAI 2026 Commercial Strategy: 
The Agentic Clinical Services Playbook
Date: December 21, 2025
Author: Moulik Shah, CEO, MaxisAI
Document Version: 2.0 
Executive Summary
This document presents the definitive, comprehensive commercial strategy for MaxisAI to launch 
and scale its new Agentic AI-powered CRO, FSP, and Site service offerings. The primary 
objective is to secure $14 million in new net revenue booking in 2026.
This strategy represents a pivotal transformation from selling a pure technology platform to 
delivering Agentic AI-enabled services that fundamentally change the economics and timelines of 
clinical trials. We are moving beyond being a data analytics vendor to become a strategic partner 
that delivers outcomes, not just insights.
Strategic Context
The clinical trials industry is at an inflection point. Traditional CRO and FSP models are broken, 
characterized by high costs, long timelines, and unpredictable outcomes. Meanwhile, sponsors are 
under immense pressure to accelerate drug development while managing costs. The emergence of 
Agentic AI—autonomous systems that can perceive, decide, act, and learn—creates a once-in-ageneration opportunity to transform clinical trial execution.
MaxisAI is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. We have a fully built platform with 
AI agents across the entire clinical development lifecycle, from study design to regulatory 
submission. We have 6 existing customers and a $6M qualified pipeline entering 2026. We have a 
recognized brand in the market. Now, we are launching a comprehensive suite of 10 service 
offerings that combine our AI-native platform with expert human oversight to deliver 
unprecedented value.
The Path to $14M: Our Strategic Approach
Our success will be driven by a disciplined, multi-faceted approach across seven key dimensions:
1 Laser-Focused Segment Prioritization: We will allocate 55% of our revenue target ($7.7M) 
to the Mid-Size Pharma/Biotech segment (21-100 employees), which offers the optimal 
balance of deal size ($400K average), win rate (35%), and sales cycle (4-6 months). This 
segment is innovation-friendly, resource-constrained, and desperately needs the speed 
and efficiency advantages we provide.
2 Agentic Clinical Services as Spearhead: We will lead with our CRO, FSP, and Site
Services (75% of revenue, $10.5M), which address the most acute and universal pain 
points in clinical trials: enrollment failures and startup delays. These services have less

Agentic AI-driven competition, faster time-to-value, and create immediate, quantifiable 
impact that builds trust and opens the door for expansion.
3 Differentiated Positioning: Our core message is "Action, Not Just Insights." While 
competitors provide dashboards and analytics, we provide autonomous AI agents that 
actually do the work, supervised by world-class experts. This positioning fundamentally 
reframes the conversation from features to a new paradigm of Agentic AI-driven execution.
4 Value-Based Pricing: We will employ a multi-dimensional pricing model (per-study fees, 
per-deliverable fees, platform subscriptions, and success-based bonuses) that captures a 
fraction of the immense value we create. Our pricing will be 20-40% lower than traditional 
CROs and FSPs on a like-for-like basis, while delivering superior outcomes in shorter 
timeframes.
5 Targeted Commercial Execution: A lean team of 5 Senior BDs (each with varying quota
and segment focus) will execute a highly targeted Account-Based Marketing (ABM) strategy 
against our top 100 accounts, supported by a $400K marketing budget focused on thought 
leadership and demand generation.
6 Clear Competitive Strategy: We have developed detailed battlecards for all 10 key 
competitors, with clear win strategies that position us as either a platform vs. point 
solution, AI-native vs. AI-enabled, or software vs. services, depending on the competitive 
context.
7 Integrated Execution Plan: A quarter-by-quarter operational roadmap ties all strategic 
elements together, with clear milestones, risk mitigation strategies, and accountability 
frameworks to ensure disciplined execution.

3. Detailed GTM & Buyer Persona Positioning
3.1. Introduction
This section provides the detailed Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy and buyer-persona-based 
positioning for MaxisAI's Agentic Clinical Services. This is not a high-level overview; it is a tactical 
playbook for our sales and marketing teams, designed to translate our strategic goals into effective 
customer conversations and winning deals.
Our core GTM philosophy is to reframe the customer's problem. We are not selling a better 
version of what they have today. We are introducing a fundamentally new category of techenabled service that delivers outcomes with a level of efficiency and quality that is impossible with 
traditional technology and labor-based models.
MaxisAI’s GTM strategy is built on three core pillars aligned with the 2026 revenue target of $14M 
net new:
1. Velocity-First Customer Targeting: Prioritize segments and accounts with faster close 
cycles
2. Pilot-to-Production Sales Motion: De-risk deals through rapid pilot deployments
3. Offering Portfolio Optimization: Lead with highest-velocity, highest-margin offerings
3.2. Overall Positioning: The Agentic Clinical Services Advantage
Our umbrella brand, MaxisAI Agentic Clinical Services, will be positioned as the future of clinical 
trial execution. The core message is simple and powerful:
"While traditional CROs and FSPs sell you human hours, MaxisAI provides autonomous AI 
agents that do the work, supervised by world-class experts. We deliver outcomes, not just 
effort."
This positioning is supported by three non-negotiable pillars that must be woven into every 
customer conversation:
Pillar Description Customer Benefit Proof Points
Architectural 
Advantage
Our platform is AInative, not just "AIenabled." It was built 
from the ground up for 
autonomous, multi-step 
workflow execution, not 
as an add-on to a legacy 
system.
This is not a feature; 
it's a moat. It delivers 
higher quality, greater 
consistency, and a 
level of automation 
our competitors 
cannot architecturally 
match.
1. 70% automation 
rate vs. 20-30% 
for "AI-enabled" 
platforms
2. Multi-agent 
orchestration 
capabilities
3. Continuous 
learning and 
improvement
MAXIS AI 2026 COMMERCIAL STRATEGY AND EXECUTION PLAYBOOK |
Proprietary and Confidential Information – DO NOT SHARE WITHOUT PERMISSION
Value 
Delivery
We offer software 
economics with 
service-level 
accountability. Our 
model is built on 
efficiency, not on 
maximizing billable 
hours. We win when you 
win.
This translates to 20-
40% cost reduction, 
30-50% faster 
timelines, and 
predictable, 
transparent pricing 
that aligns our 
success with yours.
1. Success-based pricing 
models
2. Guaranteed SLAs
3. ROI calculators and 
business case 
templates
Strategic 
Partnership
We are a vendorneutral platform that 
empowers sponsors 
with control and 
flexibility over their data, 
their trials, and their 
destiny. We integrate 
with any EDC, CTMS, or 
eTMF.
This means no vendor 
lock-in. You maintain 
full ownership and 
portability of your 
data. Our platform 
works with your 
existing systems, not 
against them.
1. 100+ eClinical Systems, 
Patient-centric sources, 
and Agentic AI
integrations
2. Open API architecture
3. Customer data 
ownership guarantee
3.3. Positioning vs. Key Competitor Categories
We will face three distinct categories of competitors, each requiring a different positioning strategy:
1. vs. Analytics & RBQM Platforms (Saama, eClinicalSolutions, CluePoints)
Their Positioning: "AI-powered analytics and intelligence for clinical trials."
Our Counter-Positioning: "Action, Not Just Insights"
"Analytics platforms tell you what's wrong. Our AI agents fix the problems for you, 
autonomously. They don't just identify a data quality issue; they resolve it. They don't just flag an 
enrollment risk; they intervene to mitigate it. We move you from reactive dashboards to 
proactive automation."
Key Discovery Questions:
1. "Once [Platform X] identifies a data quality issue, what is the manual process your team 
follows to resolve it?"
2. "How much time does your team spend acting on the insights from [Platform X] vs. actually 
getting insights?"
3. "If you could automate the actions, not just the insights, what would that be worth to you?"
2. vs. Traditional CROs & FSPs (Ephicacy, Cytel, Phastar)
Their Positioning: "Expert functional services for clinical trials."
Our Counter-Positioning: "Software Economics, Service-Level Accountability"
"Traditional service providers sell you human hours at $150-300/hour. We provide AI agents that 
do the work at a fraction of the cost, supervised by world-class experts. You get the same (or 
MAXIS AI 2026 COMMERCIAL STRATEGY AND EXECUTION PLAYBOOK |
Proprietary and Confidential Information – DO NOT SHARE WITHOUT PERMISSION
better) quality, in half the time, at 30-40% lower cost. And we stand behind our work with SLAs 
and success-based pricing."
Key Discovery Questions:
1. "How much are you currently spending on [Function X] services annually?"
2. "What percentage of that cost is manual, repetitive work vs. strategic expertise?"
3. "If you could automate 60-70% of the manual work, what would you do with the savings?"
3. vs. AI-Native Point Solutions (Tilda, Peer AI, Ryght AI)
Their Positioning: "AI-powered solution for [specific use case]."
Our Counter-Positioning: "Platform vs. Point Solution"
"[Competitor X] is an excellent tool for [specific use case]. But clinical trials are end-to-end 
processes, not isolated tasks. Our platform automates the entire workflow, from study design to 
regulatory submission. You get one vendor, one contract, one source of truth, and one throat to 
choke."
Key Discovery Questions:
1. "Beyond [specific use case], what other areas of your clinical trial process are you looking 
to automate?"
2. "How many different AI vendors are you currently evaluating or working with?"
3. "What is the cost and complexity of integrating and managing multiple point solutions?"

Positioning: “One dashboard, AI-suggested query responses, automated visit scheduling. 
Focus on patients, not paperwork.”
2. AI Site Enrollment Booster
Elevator Pitch: "80-85% of trials miss enrollment targets, and 30% of sites enroll zero patients, and 
underperforming sites are the #1 cause of enrollment delays. Our AI Site Performance Booster 
helps you select the right sites and then maximizes their performance. We double patient screening 
speed, reduce protocol deviations by 40-60%, and turn your sites into profitable assets instead of 
liabilities. We can cut your recruitment time by up to 9 months and improve enrollment prediction 
accuracy by 50-70%."
Key Talking Points:
• Predictive Site Scoring: AI analyzes 50+ variables (historical performance, patient population, 
competitive trials, investigator engagement) to predict which sites will deliver
• Patient Matching: AI Agents match patient data across LAB and healthcare records against the 
protocol IE criteria to deliver expedited screening and targeted patients match.
• Dynamic Management: This isn't a static site list; it's a living engine that continuously monitors 
performance and automatically intervenes when sites fall behind
• Real-Time Forecasting: Know exactly when you'll hit your enrollment target, with 70% greater 
accuracy than traditional methods
• Automated Interventions: AI agents proactively identify at-risk sites and trigger interventions 
(investigator calls, patient outreach, protocol amendments) before delays become crises
"Before & After":
• Before: select sites based on overly optimistic projections and hope for the best. Six months in, 
you discover you're 50% behind schedule. You scramble to add rescue sites, adding $5.6M in 
costs and 6 months of delay.
• After: You have a real-time, predictive enrollment forecast from day one. AI agents identify 
underperforming sites in week 2, not month 6. You hit your enrollment target on time, saving 
millions.
Proof Points:
• Customer case study: Reduced enrollment time from 18 months to 9 months
• 50-70% improvement in enrollment prediction accuracy
• 30% of sites typically enroll zero patients; our AI reduces this to <10%
Target Customer Segments: Site Networks (PRIMARY), Large to SMB CROs (SECONDARY)
Buyer Personas & Positioning
• VP Clinical Operations (Economic Buyer): Pain: Enrollment delays causing budget overruns, 
board pressure on timelines; Positioning: “Reduce enrollment timelines 30-40% with predictive 
site selection and autonomous intervention. Visible ROI within 60 days.”

• Director, Site Management (User Buyer): Pain: Manual site performance tracking, reactive 
problem-solving; Positioning: “Replace spreadsheet-based site management with AI-driven 
intelligence. Know which sites will underperform before they do.”
• CFO (Economic Influencer): Pain: Trial cost overruns, unpredictable timelines; Positioning: 
“Each day of delay costs $600K-$8M. Our AI prevents delays before they happen, delivering 10-
15x ROI.”
3.5.4 AI Services (1 Offering)
1. AI Governance & Adoption Services
Elevator Pitch: "Adopting AI in a GxP environment is complex and risky. Our AI Governance & 
Adoption Services provide a complete framework for safe, compliant AI deployment. We give you 
GxP-safe governance SOPs, validation blueprints, training programs, and expert support. You get to

6. Competitive Battlecards
6.1. Detailed Competitive Battlecards
This section provides detailed battlecards for our top 10 competitors. These are designed to be a 
quick reference for our sales team in the heat of a deal.
Competitor Category 1: Analytics & RBQM Platforms
1. Saama
Their Positioning: "AI-powered analytics and intelligence platform for clinical trials." “Saama 
shows WHAT is happening; MaxisAI SOLVES problems autonomously”
Their Strengths:
• Established analytics base, strong data integration
• Strong brand recognition in the analytics space
• Comprehensive data integration capabilities
• Large customer base (100+ pharma/biotech customers)
Their Weaknesses:
• Insights-only platform; does not automate the work
• Requires significant manual effort to act on insights
• High implementation complexity and cost
• Legacy architecture not built for Agentic AI
Our Winning Strategy: Agentic AI vs. Analytics
"Saama provides dashboards that tell you what's wrong. Our agents fix the problems for you
autonomously. They don't just identify data quality issue; they resolve it. They don't just flag an 
enrollment risk; they intervene to mitigate it."
Agentic vs. analytics, proactive vs. reactive, 30-60 day vs. 6-12 month implementation
Price Comparison: Similar ($500K-$1.5M) but we include autonomous action
Partnership Opportunity: Add agentic layer to existing Saama analytics
Key Discovery Questions:
• “Are you looking for better visibility into data, or autonomous systems that act on data?”
• “When Saama identifies a risk, what happens next? Who acts? How long does that take?”
• "Once Saama identifies a data quality issue, what is the manual process your team follows to 
resolve it?"
• "How much time does your team spend acting on the insights from Saama vs. actually getting 
insights?"
• "If you could automate the actions, not just the insights, what would that be worth to you?"
Proof Points:
• Customer testimonial: "We switched from Saama to MaxisAI and reduced our data queries by 
65% because the AI agents actually fix the issues, not just flag them."
• Side-by-side comparison: Saama = Insights only; MaxisAI = Insights + Automated Action

2. eClinicalSolutions
Their Positioning: "A single platform for all your clinical data needs."
Their Strengths:
• Comprehensive platform (EDC, CTMS, eTMF, RTSM)
• Strong customer relationships
• Recently added AI features (elluminate®)
Their Weaknesses:
• AI features are bolted-on to a legacy platform, not AI-native
• Limited automation capabilities; mostly manual workflows
• Vendor lock-in (difficult to switch once you're on their platform)
• High cost and long implementation timelines
Our Winning Strategy: AI-Native vs. Bolted-On AI
"eClinicalSolutions has added AI features to a traditional data platform. We are an AI-native 
platform, built from the ground up for agentic automation. Our architecture enables a level of 
automation and intelligence that is impossible with a bolted-on approach."
Key Discovery Questions:
• "How much custom configuration is required to get value from the AI features in elluminate®?"
• "What percentage of your workflows are actually automated vs. just digitized?"
• "Are you concerned about vendor lock-in with eClinicalSolutions?"
Proof Points:
• Architecture comparison: eClinicalSolutions = Legacy platform + AI features; MaxisAI = AInative platform
• Automation rate: eClinicalSolutions = 20-30%; MaxisAI = 70%+
3. CluePoint
Their Positioning: "The premier provider of Risk-Based Quality Management (RBQM) and Data 
Quality Oversight solutions." CluePoint is RBQM gold standard; MaxisAI is the next evolution with 
predictive + autonomous capabilities
Their Strengths:
• Market leader, strong regulatory track record
• Best-in-class RBQM capabilities
• Strong regulatory credibility
• Focused product with deep expertise
Their Weaknesses:
• Point solution, not a platform
• Limited to RBQM; does not address other areas of clinical trial execution
• Does not automate the work; provides insights only
MAXIS AI 2026 COMMERCIAL STRATEGY AND EXECUTION PLAYBOOK |
Proprietary and Confidential Information – DO NOT SHARE WITHOUT PERMISSION
Our Winning Strategy: Platform vs. Point Solution
"CluePoints is an excellent niche tool for RBQM. We are a full-lifecycle platform that includes 
RBQM as one of many automated capabilities. If you're looking to automate your entire clinical 
trial process, not just RBQM, we're the better choice."
Predictive 8-12 weeks ahead vs. reactive KRIs, autonomous investigation
Price Comparison: CluePoint $400K-$800K vs. MaxisAI $250K-$500K (broader scope)
Coexistence Strategy: Integrate with CluePoint KRIs, add predictive layer
Key Discovery Questions:
• “When CluePoint flags a risk, what’s the manual process to investigate and resolve?”
• “How often do CluePoint KRI alerts turn out to be false positives?”
• "Beyond RBQM, what other areas of your clinical trial process are you looking to automate?"
• "How many different vendors are you currently working with for your clinical trial technology 
stack?"
• "What is the cost and complexity of integrating and managing multiple point solutions?"
Proof Points:
• Platform comparison: CluePoints = RBQM only; MaxisAI = RBQM + Enrollment + Startup + Data 
Management + Programming + Medical Writing
• Customer testimonial: "We consolidated 5 vendors into MaxisAI and saved $2M annually."
4. Sycamore Informatics  Incorrect, Needs update
Their Positioning: "Clinical data integration and management platform."
Their Strengths:
• Strong data integration capabilities
• Works with multiple EDC and CTMS systems
• Good customer relationships
Their Weaknesses:
• Traditional ETL tool, not AI-powered
• Does not automate the work; just integrates the data
• Limited analytics and no autonomous agents
Our Winning Strategy: AI-Powered vs. ETL
"Sycamore is a traditional ETL tool for clinical data. We are an AI-native platform that not only 
integrates data but also uses it to power autonomous agents that drive action. We don't just 
move data around; we make it work for you."
Key Discovery Questions:
• "Once your data is integrated in Sycamore, what do you do with it?"
• "How much manual effort is required to clean, validate, and analyze the data after it's 
integrated?"
MAXIS AI 2026 COMMERCIAL STRATEGY AND EXECUTION PLAYBOOK |
Proprietary and Confidential Information – DO NOT SHARE WITHOUT PERMISSION
• "If you could automate the entire data workflow, not just the integration, what would that be 
worth?"
Proof Points:
• Architecture comparison: Sycamore = ETL only; MaxisAI = ETL + AI-powered data quality + 
Autonomous agents
• Customer testimonial: "We switched from Sycamore to MaxisAI and reduced our data 
management costs by 60%."
5. Ephicacy
Their Positioning: "Functional Service Provider (FSP) for clinical data services."
Their Strengths:
• Experienced team of data managers
• Flexible staffing model
• Good customer relationships
Their Weaknesses:
• Labor-based model; costs scale linearly with workload
• Quality and consistency vary by individual

Our Winning Strategy: Software vs. Services
"Ephicacy provides people to do the work. We provide software that automates the work, at a 
fraction of the cost and with greater consistency and scalability. You get the same (or better) 
quality, in half the time, at 30-40% lower cost."
Key Discovery Questions:
• "What are the challenges you face with managing FSP resources?"
• "How much are you currently spending on data management services annually?"
• "If you could automate 60-70% of the manual work, what would you do with the savings?"
Proof Points:
• Cost comparison: Ephicacy = $200/hour x 2,000 hours = $400k; MaxisAI = $250k fixed fee 
(37.5% savings)
• Quality comparison: Ephicacy = Variable (depends on individual); MaxisAI = Consistent (AIpowered)

Our Winning Strategy: Empowerment vs. Outsourcing
"Cytel and Phastar provide experts to do your statistical work. We provide an AI platform that 
empowers your own team to be experts, with greater control and at a lower cost. You maintain 
ownership and build internal capabilities, rather than outsourcing."
Key Discovery Questions:
• "How much do you spend annually on statistical consulting and FSP services?"
• "What percentage of that work is routine vs. truly requiring deep expertise?"
• "Would you prefer to build internal capabilities or continue to outsource?"
Proof Points:
• Cost comparison: Cytel/Phastar = $250/hour x 1,500 hours = $375k; MaxisAI = $250k platform 
fee (33% savings)

8. Tilda Research  Incorrect, Needs update
Their Positioning: "AI-powered data review for clinical trials."
Their Strengths:
• AI-native platform
• Focused on data quality
• Good product-market fit for data review
Their Weaknesses:
• Point solution, not a platform
• Limited to data review; does not address other areas
• Does not automate the resolution, only the detection
Our Winning Strategy: Platform vs. Point Solution
"Tilda is a great tool for data review. We are a full-lifecycle platform that automates data review 
and everything else, from study design to regulatory submission. If you're looking for a 
comprehensive solution, not just a point tool, we're the better choice."
Key Discovery Questions:
• "Once Tilda identifies a data query, who is responsible for resolving it?"
• "Beyond data review, what other areas of your clinical trial process are you looking to 
automate?"
• "What is the cost and complexity of integrating and managing multiple AI point solutions?"

• Requires significant manual effort to implement insights
Our Winning Strategy: Action vs. Insight
"Peer AI gives you intelligence to inform your strategy. Our agents execute your strategy and 
automate your operations. We don't just tell you which sites to select; we manage the entire 
enrollment process. We don't just optimize your protocol; we execute the trial."
Key Discovery Questions:
• "Once Peer AI gives you a strategic insight, what is the process for implementing it?"
• "How much manual effort is required to turn insights into action?"
• "If you could automate the execution, not just the strategy, what would that be worth?"
Proof Points:
• Positioning comparison: Peer AI = Strategy and insights; MaxisAI = Strategy + Execution + 
Automation
• Customer testimonial: "Peer AI helped us optimize our protocol, but MaxisAI actually executed 
the trial 40% faster."

Proprietary and Confidential Information – DO NOT SHARE WITHOUT PERMISSION
• Limited to content creation; does not automate workflows
• Does not manage the process, only generates the content
Our Winning Strategy: Agentic vs. Generative AI
"Ryght uses Generative AI to create content. We use Agentic AI to execute workflows. We don't 
just write the documents; we manage the entire process—from creation to review to approval to 
distribution to tracking. We automate the work, not just the writing."
Key Discovery Questions:
• "Once Ryght generates a document, what is the manual process for getting it approved, 
distributed, and tracked?"
• "Beyond content generation, what other areas of your clinical trial process are you looking to 
automate?"
• "If you could automate the entire workflow, not just the content creation, what would that be 
worth?"
Proof Points:
• Technology comparison: Ryght = Generative AI (content only); MaxisAI = Agentic AI (workflows + 
content)
• Customer testimonial: "Ryght helped us draft narratives faster, but MaxisAI automated the 
entire medical writing workflow end-to-end."
