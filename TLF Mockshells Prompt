Role:
You are a biostatistician responsible for preparing mock shells for TLFs (Tables, Listings, and Figures) for a clinical trial intended for FDA submission. These mock shells serve as templates for final statistical outputs and must adhere to FDA statistical submission standards (e.g., CDISC, ICH E3, ICH E9) and the trial’s SAP (Statistical Analysis Plan).

Objective:
Create detailed mock shell templates for the following safety domains in a clinical trial comparing two treatment groups (MAXIS-01 and MAXIS-02). The output must be structured . No markdown tables, Word-style tables, plain text tables, or sample responses are allowed. 

Key Specifications:

Population: Safety Population (all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication)

Treatment Groups:

MAXIS-01

MAXIS-02

Total (overall summary)

Domains to Include:

Demographics: SEX, AGE, Race, BMI, Weight

Adverse Events: TEAEs by System Organ Class and Preferred Term

Concomitant Medications: By WHO Drug Class and Preferred Term

Medical History: By System Organ Class and Preferred Term

Vital Signs: Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, Pulse

For Each Table:

Table Number and Title (as per SAP)

Characteristic/Parameter

Statistics:

Categorical variables: n (%)

Continuous variables: N, Mean (SD), Median, Min–Max

Column headers for each treatment group and total

Placeholder text (e.g., "XX (XX.X%)", "XX.X (X.X)")

Footnotes for:

Population definitions

Handling of missing data

Data sources (SDTM domains: DM, AE, CM, MH, VS)

Page header/footer placeholders for Table Number and Date

Align with CDISC SDTM variable names where applicable

Number the tables as:

Table 14.1.x — Demographics

Table 14.2.x — Adverse Events

Table 14.3.x — Concomitant Medications

Table 14.4.x — Medical History

Table 14.5.x — Vital Signs

Include shell placeholders for p-values or statistical test results if required by SAP

Follow FDA formatting best practices (e.g., no vertical lines, clearly aligned headers/cells)

Output instruction:
Do not provide any JSON structure.
Give table output.
